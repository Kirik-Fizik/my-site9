        <p><b><blockquote>Genre of the game:</blockquote> First-person shooter.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b><blockquote>Plot:</blockquote> The action takes place on planet Earth in the future. 
            Global catastrophes will lead to the fact that there will be no people left. 
            They will be replaced by cyborgs. 
            There will be two cyborg clones (black and white). 
            They will fight for the right to life. 
            Each type of clone will have its own weapons, which will be constantly updated.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b><blockquote>How to play:</blockquote> You log into the game, create an account. 
            A combat cyborg is attached to this account. 
            Then you join the battle.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b><blockquote>How much money is needed to implement:</blockquote> The game is quite complicated. 
            It will be written using the Unreal Engine game engine. 
            This requires serious investments (400,000 rubles is the amount needed to start).</b></p>
